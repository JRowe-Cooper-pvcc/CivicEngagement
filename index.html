<h3>Question: To what extent should a government censor its citizensâ€™ access to the internet (or any international network)? What about issues that involve national security?</h3>
<p>Government censorship of the internet is a difficult issue that requires balancing the need for national security with  free speech and open access to information. Some argue that restrictions help prevent the spread of harmful content, misinformation, and cyber threats. On the other hand, such control undermines democratic values and suppresses individual freedoms. This could lead to a society where technology is used by the government to oppress people.
    To understand both sides of the debate, I explored the advantages and disadvantages of government censorship.</p>
